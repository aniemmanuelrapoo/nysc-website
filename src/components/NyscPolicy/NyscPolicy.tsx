                Non-Personally Identifiable Information<br />
                In your use of the website, we may collect any information that you voluntarily share with us. This information may be collected when you send us emails or voluntarily submit information to us via the website or inquiry page. This information may include your (1) contact information (such as name, address, email address and phone number), (2) age, (3) gender, (4) date of birth, and (5) any other information you choose to provide us, subject to applicable laws and the terms of this Privacy Policy. We may use third party service providers to assist us in collecting and maintaining this personally identifiable information. However, we require such service providers to maintain the confidentiality of such information.<br /><br /><br />

                <h5>4.0    How We Use the Information We Collect</h5>
                Non-Personally Identifiable Information <br />
                We use non-personally identifiable information in the aggregate to determine how much traffic the website receives, to statistically analyze its usage, to improve our content, and to customize the website's content, layout and services. In addition, we may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, to manage and to enhance the website based on the usage pattern data we receive.

                Personally Identifiable Information <br />
                We will use personally identifiable information for:(i) the purpose for which you provide it; (ii) as otherwise may be disclosed at the point of collection; and/or (iii) for the purposes described below. For example, we may use your contact information as provided to us in General Inquiries, such as email address, telephone number, and/or mailing address, to contact you regarding administrative notices and communications related to your use of the website or otherwise as you may request, such as for an employment application.
                In providing our services to you, your personal information may be disclosed to or collected by third party suppliers and service providers specifically involved in the processing of your information received via the website and as otherwise necessary to manage this website and provide the services you request. In addition, we may use your personal information in the aggregate in a non-identifiable way in order to better understand the services being provided, how to improve these services and how to improve the website. We may provide this aggregated information to third parties, but when we do so, we do not provide any of your information without your express permission.
                We may also use or disclose your personal information and review the status or activity of multiple users to resolve disputes, investigate problems, and enforce our Terms of Use or any other agreement with NYSC. We may disclose or access information whenever we believe in good faith that the law so requires, upon sale or reorganization of our organization or some or all of its assets, or if we otherwise consider it necessary to do so to maintain service and improve our products and services. Except as stated above, we will never sell, distribute, or release to a third party your personal information without your express permission.<br /><br /><br />

                <h5>5.0    Access to Your Personally Identifiable Information</h5>
                Upon written request and verification of your identity, we will provide you with your personal information in our possession as well as the personal information, if any, that we have disclosed to third parties. Requests for such information should be sent to the contact information below.<br /><br /><br />

                <h5>6.0    Handling of Electronic Records and Backup</h5>
                In general, we will retain all information collected through the NYSC website for, at a minimum, the length of time permitted by law. However, we will delete any personally identifiable information in our database upon your request or as otherwise required by law. We may, however, retain non-personally identifiable information indefinitely.
                We maintain backup files as a protection against natural disasters, equipment failures, or other disruptions. Backup files protect you and us because they lower the risk of losing valuable data. Backup files may contain records with your personal information. Removing a record from our active files and databases does not remove that record from any backup systems. Such backup data will eventually be passively deleted as backup records are erased through the normal recycling of backup files. In the meantime, as long as backup records exist, they receive the same security protections as our other records.<br /><br /><br />

                <h5>7.0    Security</h5>
                Communications between your browser and portions of the NYSC website containing personally identifiable information are protected with Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption. This encryption is to help protect your information while it is being transmitted. Once we receive your information, we strive to maintain the physical and electronic security of your personal information using commercially reasonable efforts.
                No data transmission over the internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be perfectly secured. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information using commercially available and standard encryption technology, we cannot ensure or guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.<br /><br /><br />

                <h5>8.0    In the Event of a Security Breach of Your Personal Information</h5>
                If we determine that, your personal information has or may reasonably have been disclosed due to a security breach of our systems, we will notify you, at the contact information provided to us, in accordance with and to the extent required by applicable state and federal law.<br /><br />
                <h5>8.1    Personal Right</h5>
                You have the right to take the complaints about how we process your personal data to the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA).
